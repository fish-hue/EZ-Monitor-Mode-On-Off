# Turn Monitor Mode on and Off with a simple script.

In the terminal run: git clone https://github.com/fish-hue/mmoo.git

Navigate to the cloned /mmoo folder

Enter: chmod +x mmoo.sh

Run: ./mmoo.sh

Follow the prompt to enable/disable monitor mode, or exit the script.

For example we will 'Enable monitor mode' and select option 1
 
A list of interfaces will appear, enter the full name of the interface you wish to interact with as listed i.e. wlan0 and the script will then execute.

To undo changes simply re-run the script.
